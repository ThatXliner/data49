> A gold rush-themed data mining library

WIP

<!-- It is split into the following sections:

  - **Web-related utilities** wrapping web scraping with Beautiful Soup and requests or browser automation with Selenium. Found in the `web` namespace
  - **Logging** Logging made super easy. Found in the `log` namespace

Currently, only the web-related utilities are implemented

## Features
